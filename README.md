# The Euclidean distance
 is really just a fancy name for the imaginary straight line between two points.The most common heuristic method for approximating the travel distance from one point to another is the Euclidean distance.

# The Manhattan Distance
   The Manhattan Distance is the distance between two points measured along the axes at right angles. It derives its name from the fact that the distance is calculated allowing only left/right and up/down movements, just as one would travel through the streets of Manhattan, New York.

# The Greedy Best-First Search
 (Greedy BFS) algorithm shares most of its code with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, except that it expands its way by selecting the node closest to the goal. To estimate how far from the goal any node is, an heuristic function is used
